                        <h2>Farmers Health: Pathway to Economic Independence and Growth</h2>
                        <p>At BreakTech, we endeavour to highlight the
                        critical role of women in food security and the
                        need for targeted support and policies that
                        empower them. During 2020/2021 COVID
                        pandemic, a significantly negative impact on
                        the health of many women farmers in Uganda
                        was left by COVID-19. As the backbone of food
                        production and household sustenance, these
                        farmers faced many unprecedented
                        challenges, such as declined health and
                        wellbeing, restricted access to markets,
                        limited availability of essential resources, and
                        increased household responsibilities and
                        caregiving duties due to school closures and
                        health concerns.</p>
</br>
                        <p> Their ability to engage in farming activities was further hindered with the lockdowns and movement
                            restrictions, which disrupted supply chains, making it difficult for women to sell their produce, and to
                            secure inputs and resources like seeds and fertilizers, as well as restricting their access financial
                            services.</p>
</br>
                        <p>Through our advisory and CSR strategies, BreakTech endeavours to prioritise the creation of a healthier
                        and more equitable future for Ugandaâ€™s women farmers through access to healthcare by enhancing
                        access to comprehensive health services, including maternal and reproductive health, mental health
                        support, and nutrition programs..</p>
