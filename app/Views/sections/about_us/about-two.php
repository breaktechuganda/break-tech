      <h2>Audience:</h2>
      <p>
          BreakTech Business Advisory Service is designed to target young, small-scale farmers, with special
          emphasis on women who are passionate about agriculture and are eager to learn, as a bid to ensure
          that the next generation is equipped with the skills and knowledge needed for modern farming.
          Women are key decision-makers and often play crucial roles in agricultural decisions, from budgeting
          to crop management. By engaging them, the service can better address the actual needs and
          perspectives within farming households. BreakTech, therefore, is able to strengthen and promote
          community ties, networking, sustainable development and knowledge sharing among families
          through the women.
